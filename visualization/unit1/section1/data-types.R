# Data types 

# 1st step on how to visualize: know what type of data it is!

# categorical and numerical variables 
# categorical: ordinal, non-ordinal 
# numerical: discrete, continuous 

# categorical --> small number of groups (e.g sex, regions)
# can also be ordered (eg spiciness --> mild, medium, hot), eg ordinal 

# numeric --> numbers :D 
#   continuous --> can take ANY value 
#   discrete --> have to be round numbers
