# Introduction to distributions

# Numerical values --> often summarized by an average 
# Occasionally, standard deviation is often reported 
# eg 680 +/- 50

# In some cases, these 2 numbers are pretty much all we need
# But data visualization can help determine if this summary is appropriate 

# Most basic statistical summary of a list of numerics is a distribution
